<h2>9. User Blocking</h2>

<h3>9.1 Description</h3>
<p>
  You have the ability to block another user in case you don't want to see the
  other user's content. This feature is designed to ensure a safe, respectful
  environment for all users and minimize unwanted interactions.
</p>

<h3>9.2 Accessing the blocking functionality</h3>

<p>
  The blocking functionality can be accessed by going to the user profile that
  you would like to block, selecting the 3-dot menu button in the top-right
  corner, and selecting the "Block user" option.
</p>

<h3>9.3 User blocking outcome</h3>

<p>In case you block another user, the following will happen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will no longer see the blocked user.</li>
  <li>
    The blocked user will not be able to see your profile or content (events,
    comments, and others).
  </li>
  <li>
    The blocked user's event comments will be displayed as "Blocked user's
    comment". The username will be shown as "[blocked user]". The blocked user's
    profile image will not be displayed (a placeholder image is used instead).
    The subcomments under the comments of the blocked user will not be shown to
    you. If you tap on the placehoder profile image or placeholder username,
    you'll be notified that this is a blocked user and asked whether you'd like
    to view the blocked user profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    The blocked user will not be able to see your comments. They will be shown
    as unavailable. Your real username and profile image will not be displayed
    (a placehoder username and image are used instead). The subcomments under
    the unavailable comments will not be shown to the blocked user. If the
    blocked user taps on your placehoder profile image or placeholder username,
    nothing will happen.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the participant list of events created by a third user, both you and the
    blocked user will not be able to see each other. For transparency, the
    blocked user will be shown in the participant list using a placeholder
    profile image. If you tap on the placehoder profile image, you'll be
    notified that this is a blocked user and asked whether you'd like to view
    the blocked user's profile. Only if you confirm that you'd like to see the
    blocked user's profile, then you will be redirected to the blocked user's
    profile page. On the other hand, if the blocked user taps on your
    placeholder profile image, nothing will happen.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will be automatically removed from the participant list of all active
    events created by the blocked user. The blocked user will be removed from
    all active events created by you.
  </li>
  <li>All notifications from the blocked user will be removed for you.</li>
  <li>
    You will be removed from the followings list of the blocked user. The
    blocked user will be removed from your followers list.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <i>Note:</i> Please note that if you choose to view the blocked user's
  profile, you have the possibility to unblock the user, by using the "Unblock
  user" option in the same 3-dot menu in the top-right corner of the blocked
  user's profile page.
</p>
